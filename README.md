# PiTrex chess

This is an early stage and "brute force" port of chess to the PiTrex. 
Next steps are:

TODO:
- **Visual feedback of wrong moves**
- Different optimisations

DONE:
- Animated movements of the chess figures
- Improve drawings (Change lines to linestrips)
- Put chess engine in 2nd thread to avoid screen waiting times
- XCode playgorund

Future plans:
- Change of side in game
- Suport of all "special" moves
- 3D View
