# PiTrex chess

This is an early stage and "brute force" port of chess to the PiTrex. 
Next steps are:

- Improve drawings (Change lines to linestrips)
- Put chess engine in 2nd thread to avoid screen waiting times
- Visual feedback of wrong moves
- Animated movements of the chess figures
- Different optimisations

Future plans:
- Change of color in game
- Suport of all "special" moves
- 3D View
